Service

A Service sits between a Source and a Sink, but isn't essential.

A Service takes in 1-n amount of Stuff and returns 1-m amount of Stuff.

An example of a Service is a Factory (takes in sand) to make Glass. Or another Factory (takes in glass and wood) to make Window Panes. Or a farm (takes in food) to make manure and meat.
