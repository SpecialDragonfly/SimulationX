Source

A source is a place that Stuff can be retrieved from.

Sources have a rule set and are separate services which are commuicated to and given the state at that point in time to see how they react.

They don't know anything about where they are in an environment, they just exist.

An example of a Source is a Forest (which gives wood), or a Beach (which gives sand) or an Asteroid (which gives ore).

Sources can therefore expire.

Sources should have an initial state that can be advertised on instantiation.
